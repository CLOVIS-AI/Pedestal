 * This class represents the state at a specific time of the result of requesting a [reference][Ref].

 * - the request is finished and successful,
 * - the request is finished and failed,
 * - the request is not finished,
 * - the request is not finished, but we remember the previous value for the same request.
 *
 * These states are encoded by the values of [data] and [status], for example a finished request that was successful will
 * have [data] be an instance of [Result.Success], with the result being available using [Result.Success.value], and the
 * [status] attribute will be [Status.Completed].
 * Read the documentation of the various values to understand all the possible combinaisons.
 *
 * Use destructuration to easily access the various values:
 * ```kotlin
 * val (data, status) = someData()
 * ```
 *
 * This class represents the state of some data at a specific instant in time, which it does not store.
 * This class will often appear inside a [Flow], allowing to subscribe to updates to the state as requests terminate.
