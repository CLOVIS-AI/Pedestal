/**
 * A reference to a specific [object][O].
 *
 * A reference is a small object that allows to pass around an object from an API without querying it.
 * A reference should always be immutable.
 * Each reference has a matching [Backbone] object responsible for managing it.
 *
 * [Ref] implementation should ensure that their [equals] and [hashCode] functions are correct.
 *
 * To access the value behind a reference, use [request].
 *
 * ### Note for implementors
 *
 * When implementing this interface, it is common to provide functions to all mutating methods from the matching
 * [Backbone] as wrappers to it. This makes using the reference easier.
 *
 * @param O The object this reference refers to.
 * @param F Failures that may be returned when calling [request].
