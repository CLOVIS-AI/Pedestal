# Pedestal â€¢ Software architecture utilities

OpenSavvy Pedestal is a collection of open source utilities for unified software architecture, aiming to solve common problems in a simple and elegant way.

- [Pedestal Backbone](backbone/README.md) unifies API architecture by including caching and efficient transfers directly into the API itself.
- Pedestal Spine (TODO) allows Backbone implementations to interact with each other transparently through a network boundary.
