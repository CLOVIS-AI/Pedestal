# Module state-arrow

Compatibility layer for `state` and [Arrow Core](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/core/).

The `state` project is an error management framework for immutable data with progress management using `progress`.
Arrow Core is particularly great at representing business failures, and `state` was created to be completely compatible.
We encourage any project that has the option to use Arrow Core alongside `state`, using this compatibility module.
