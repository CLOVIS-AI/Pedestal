The Baseline playground contains common configuration we use in all our projects.

[TOC]

## JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStormâ€¦)

OpenSavvy recommends using IntelliJ-based IDEs from JetBrains.
The Playground contains configuration for multiple aspects of the project. 

### Code style

The Playground contains the configuration to follow the [OpenSavvy coding style](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/wiki/-/blob/main/coding-style/README.md).

The Playground also has the [Git Toolbox](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7499-gittoolbox) configuration to check that commits confirm to our commit style.

### Copyright

The Playground contains the license text for the licenses [approved by OpenSavvy](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/wiki/-/blob/main/licensing/README.md).

To use a license in your project, go to `File | Settings | Editor | Copyright` and change the default project copyright, or create various scopes to use different licenses in different areas of the project. 

## GitLab

### CI/CD

The Playground has configuration for GitLab CI for the basic workflow.
