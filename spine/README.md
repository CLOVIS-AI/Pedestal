# Module Spine (DEPRECATED)

> Pedestal Spine is deprecated, and will be removed in the future.

Pedestal Spine is a framework allowing the declaration of fullstack Kotlin APIs and data validation in common code, which can later be used to call endpoints on the client-side or implement them on the server-side with type safety.
