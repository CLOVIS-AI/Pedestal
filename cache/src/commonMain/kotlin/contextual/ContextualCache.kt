/**
 * Stores information temporarily to avoid unneeded network requests.
 *
 * Unlike [Cache], a contextual cache stores multiple values per identifier.
 * The context decides which value is visible.
 * Here are a few examples of context usage:
 * - authentication information (different users see different values)
 * - paging information (different values are returned depending on the requested page)
 *
 * The main advantage of using this interface rather than using a compound key in [Cache] is that it is possible to
 * expire a value for all contexts.
 *
 * In all other regards (cache states, cache chainingâ€¦), this interface is identical to [Cache].
 * [Cache] can be seen as a specialization of this interface for the case where the context is [Unit].
 *
 * @param I The identifier used to request from the cache.
 * @param C The context which differentiates between cache results.
 * @param F The possible failures when requesting the cache.
 * @param T The possible successful value when requesting the cache.
