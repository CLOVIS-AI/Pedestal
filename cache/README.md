# Module Cache

Pedestal Cache is a collection of in-process cache algorithms.

Caching is a powerful technique which allows to dramatically reduce I/O requests, making applications faster and more responsive.
For more information on our recommendations for cache-aware software architecture, see the Backbone module.

This library provides multiplatform cache algorithms, which can be used in the same manner client- and server-side. Based on coroutines, they are suitable for high-performance applications as well as mobile web pages. Our goal is to keep this library as lightweight as possible.

## Cache operations

Caches behave as key-value stores which are able to query the value automatically. The essential operations are:

- `get`: to request the value behind a key,
- `expire`: to notify the cache that we know the value has changed,
- `update`: to notify the cache that we know what the most recent value for a given key is.

Additionally, `get` returns a long-lived [Flow][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow] you can subscribe to, to be notified of future changes to the value. This is particularly useful when using reactive UI frameworks (React, Composeâ€¦), as it allows to directly communicate to the framework which parts of the UI change, meaning all components reading from the cache automatically update themselves on new values, with no additional code.

## Layering

Complex caching strategies are created by composing simpler implementations. Here is an example of a cache which will store values in-memory for 10 minutes:

```kotlin
val scope: CoroutineScope = TODO()

val powersOfTwo = cache<Int, Int> { it * 2 }
	.cachedInMemory(scope.coroutineContext.job)
	.expireAfter(10.minutes, scope, clock)

println(powersOfTwo[5].now())
```

The initial layer (here, the `cache` factory) is an adapter to expose a regular function as a cache instance, to bootstrap layering. It doesn't do any caching itself.

# Package opensavvy.cache

Reactive key-value store algorithms represented by the [`Cache`][opensavvy.cache.Cache] interface.

For convenience, adapters are provided:

- [`cache`][opensavvy.cache.cache] caches calls to any `suspend` function,
- [`batchingCache`][opensavvy.cache.batchingCache] intercepts subsequent cache requests and batches them into a single larger request.

The following cache layers are available:

- [`cachedInMemory`][opensavvy.cache.cachedInMemory] stores results in-memory. When values are updated, it continues to show the old values while the new ones are being fetched,
- [`expireAfter`][opensavvy.cache.expireAfter] expires the values stored by the previous layer after some time has passed.

# Package opensavvy.cache.contextual

Reactive key-context-value store algorithms represented by the [`ContextualCache`][opensavvy.cache.contextual.ContextualCache] interface.

For convenience, adapters are provided:

- [`cache`][opensavvy.cache.contextual.cache] caches calls to any `suspend` function,
- [`batchingCache`][opensavvy.cache.contextual.batchingCache] intercepts subsequent cache requests and batches them into a single larger request.

The following cache layers are available:

- [`cachedInMemory`][opensavvy.cache.contextual.cachedInMemory] stores results in-memory. When values are updated, it continues to show the old values while the new ones are being fetched,
- [`expireAfter`][opensavvy.cache.contextual.expireAfter] expires the values stored by the previous layer after some time has passed.
